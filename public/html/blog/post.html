                    <p>Being someone who has struggled in the past to understand what could drive a person to write a blog post, I feel grateful the inspiration has come to me at this nascent stage of my developer career. As I also happen to making my very first portfolio site, I can now at least include one post on the blog page. One post. About the dangers of freelance work, politics, and trust.</p>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>
                    <strong>Let’s talk about D.</strong> <br><br>
                    D is currently an attendee of a full-stack web development bootcamp in Provo, UT. <br><br>
                    He began his adventure in web development after obtaining a four-year degree yet finding his job prospects unsatisfying. <br><br>
                    Unfortunately for D, being a student for 50+ hours a week severely restricted his income. So he patiently continued to learn, and diligently practiced his skills eagerly anticipating the day when he could test their value on the open market. <br><br>
                    Finally an opportunity arose. Another bootcamp student, this one in California, needed a MEAN stack developer to throw together a “simple” single page app for a mock used car dealer. <br><br>
                    ‘A perfect way to test my skills’, thought D. This was precisely the sort of thing which he had spent every day practicing. <br><br>
                    So they struck a deal between themselves. And D went to work. <br><br>
                    He started from nothing. That was the part he loved most, nothing, but a cursor on a blank terminal window. And from that he made files and folders, and he filled those with words. <br><br>
                    All weekend long. Until the nothing looked remarkably like the website for a used car dealer. <br><br>
                    But when the time came to deliver and collect payment, D found himself with a problem: How do I make sure that he pays me if I give him the code? <br><br>
                    He recognized what every developer would at this stage: access to the code was his only leverage. And it was a power that once relinquished, even for a moment, could never be regained. <br><br>
                    He was aware of a solution, an online service which charged a 20% fee, but would have lent the agreement the authority of an employment contract. <br><br>
                    He opted instead to trust the student. Besides, he’d seen it done it in movies a hundred times. Half-up front, half after. <br><br>
                    D collected the $125 up front and released the code. <br><br>
                    Remotely, he helped the student install it on his machine. He added a module at the student’s request. He explained a little about the interface. <br><br>
                    He asked if the work was satisfactory. <br><br>
                    The student responded by refusing to pay the second half of the agreed upon price, with little more justification than it didn’t "feel" worth the full amount to him. THEN ENDED COMMUNICATION.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>If you’ve made it through this self-indulgent narrative you might have some thoughts on what an idiot 'D' might be when there is a perfectly simple solution staring him right in the face. I would encourage to please share that in comments below. I for one think he might have used a screen-share to demo the functionality of the website without giving up the code. Or perhaps my site was only worth $125 to the student and it doesn’t matter how the site was demonstrated.</p>

                    <p>As I forray further into freelancing, I continue to struggle with accurately assessing a fair market-value for my work. As for the trust issue, I can only hope that $125 will prove an inexpensive price to pay for an early lesson in the value of enforceable contracts and clearly defined deliverables. Probably a metaphor about ‘quick-and-dirty’ solutions in there, too. It was the guys vagueness in his dissatisfaction, and how he immediately ended communication that made me feel like I had been ripped off. Even when I tracked him down (on his youtube page) he failed to provide any more actionable feedback.</p>
